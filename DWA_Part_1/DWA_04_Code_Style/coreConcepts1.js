Results showed that projects using linters had on average a 14,7% lower defect density(
number of defects per thousand lines of code) compared to projects that did not use linters.

Also found varying effects of linter usage based on programming language and the specific linter tool.
JS projects using ESLint saw 27% reduction in defects density compared to projects without linters.
Python projects using PyLint experienced 9% reduction.


Style =
- indentation
        js compiler dont care of indentation and line breaks but can cause code
        not to work as expected
        minified js is single line
        bullet list - see things inside other.
        spaces/tans?
        example.js
        must be consistent
        toggle render whit space

Structuring JS

3 things that can go wrong:
1 avoidable dumb errors
2 less avoidable errors
3 unavoidable errors
low level bugs easy to fix
mid level serious bugs - have to outskill

get out of low level


complex systems
precision
    manage for fixing
     understanding of low level el
     identifying issues
      analize possible solutions
      mindfull of how small things can break large things
interlated/cross-functional
    team of skills
    meant to be read code
    make code fit

 first story
64 bit -> 16 bit

c1 = 9;
c3 = ''; //coerce
c2 = 13;
ang = 0.0002 + c3; //'0.0002'
o1 = c3 * c1;
o2 = c3 - c1;
o3 = o1 / o2;
alt = 4000000;
vel = ang * alt;
console.log('horizontal velocity', vel)

second story
pounds/newtons
const force = 50
force * 10

example:
p = 9;
m = 2000;
vel = 1000;
acc = 2;
frcp = m * acc;
n = 5;
time = 10;
frcn = frcp * 4.44822;
cc = 3 / n;
acc2 = 90410 + p;
final = vel + (frcp / m) * time //should apply frcn instead
console.log('final velocity', final)

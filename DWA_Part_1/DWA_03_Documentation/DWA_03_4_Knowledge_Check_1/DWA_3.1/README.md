### Introduction
The calendar is implemented in JavaScript and generates an HTML table representing a month's calendar. It utilizes CSS classes to style the cells differently based on certain criteria, such as today's date, weekend days, and alternate weeks.

### Features
Dynamic Generation: The calendar dynamically generates the HTML for a month, taking into account the start day of the week, the total number of days in the month, and the current date.
Custom Styling: Different CSS classes are applied to cells based on whether they represent today, a weekend day, or belong to an alternate week.
Readability: The calendar is easy to read and visually organized, with weeks labeled on the sidebar.

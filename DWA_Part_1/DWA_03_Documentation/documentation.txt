  CORE CONCEPTS PART 2

  Here's a summarized bullet point list based on the provided text:

  - **Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
    - Emphasizes writing documentation before code.
    - Not about excessive planning but understanding what needs to be done.
    - Acknowledges the dynamic nature of development, allowing for prototyping.

  - **Mapping Out App Components:**
    - Identifying key components, e.g., tasks.
    - Suggests starting with concrete examples rather than abstract thinking.
    - Illustrates the use of code blocks to define JavaScript objects.

  - **Storing Tasks in Objects:**
    - Proposes using objects instead of arrays for task storage.
    - Highlights the need for a unique identifier (UUID) for each task.
    - Discusses considerations for enforcing uniqueness in keys.

  - **Task Object Properties:**
    - Defines properties for tasks, including title, completed status, creation date, urgency, and due date.
    - Introduces the concept of displaying tasks based on an array of IDs.
    - Adds filters for search, urgency, and sorting options (most recent, oldest, upcoming).

  - **Documentation and JSDoc:**
    - Advocates using JSDoc for documenting code.
    - Demonstrates JSDoc syntax for parameters, returns, and optional parameters.
    - Introduces the `@type` keyword for creating custom types.
    - Explains the use of the pipe operator for type unions.
    - Encourages the creation of custom types for objects, such as the task type.

  - **VS Code and Type Checking:**
    - Mentions the use of `@ts-check` at the top of files in VS Code for type checking.
    - Shows how VS Code can provide warnings for type-related issues.
    - Recommends using `any` as a temporary solution for unknown types but advises against it for security reasons.

  - **Custom Types for Objects:**
    - Illustrates creating custom types, such as `Task` and `Location`.

    Certainly! Here's a summarized bullet-point list based on the provided code and comments:

    **Types and Custom Types:**
    - Created custom types for "Filters" and "Sorting" to manage tasks.
    - Used union types to extend the "Urgency" type, allowing for specific urgencies or a generic "any" option.

    **State Management:**
    - Defined a custom type "State" to represent the application state.
    - Used the "Record" keyword for dynamic object types (e.g., tasks) with predefined keys and values.
    - Started creating documentation for the state, including the structure and purpose of each property.

    **Function Documentation:**
    - Demonstrated how to document functions using JSDoc comments.
    - Provided a sample function ("createID") documentation with details about its purpose and expected parameters.
